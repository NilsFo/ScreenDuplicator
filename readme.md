# Neo Time Overlay

An old *Java* based application, bult during my early years of Java development.
Archived via GitHub and retrace my roots.

# How to use

Run it and select an area on your screen.
That area will be monitored by the application and mirrored in a second window.
*Infinite realities! Weeeee!*

# Known issues

 - Only works on the primary display

# Good old times

Developed some time in 2014.
Wow, I'm old.
